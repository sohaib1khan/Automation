# Chatbot App Deployment with Skaffold

## Overview

This document provides a high level guide on deploying a Python-based chatbot application using Skaffold and Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Docker** - Ensure Docker is installed and running.
2.  **Kubernetes** - A running Kubernetes cluster. In this case, I used a local cluster.
3.  **Skaffold** - Install Skaffold for automating the build and deployment process.

## Steps

1.  **Application and Docker Setup**
    
    - Utilized a Python-based chatbot application.
    - A `Dockerfile` was crafted to build the container image.
2.  **Skaffold Configuration**
    
    - A `skaffold.yaml` file was created which details the processes of building, pushing, and deploying the application.
    - This configuration references the Kubernetes deployment specifications.
3.  **Kubernetes Deployment Setup**
    
    - Set up a `k8s-deployment.yaml` which provides the specifications for the deployment, service, persistent volumes, and more in the Kubernetes cluster.
    - Defined a namespace specifically for the chatbot app to provide an isolated environment for our resources.
    - Persistent Volume (PV) and Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) were established for storage persistence.
4.  **Launching the Deployment**
    
    - With everything in place, running `skaffold run` did the magic:
        1.  The Docker image was built.
        2.  Image was pushed to the Docker registry.
        3.  Application was deployed to the Kubernetes cluster.
5.  **Monitoring and Debugging**
    
    - Used Skaffold's live logging feature to monitor the application and troubleshoot any potential issues.

## Conclusion

Skaffold proved to be an efficient and powerful tool in streamlining the development to deployment workflow for Kubernetes applications. With just a few configurations, the entire process from building the image to deploying it on a cluster was automated, saving time and minimizing manual errors.
