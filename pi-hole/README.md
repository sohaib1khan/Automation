This guide walks you through deploying Pi-hole on a Kubernetes cluster while managing sensitive information using Kubernetes Secrets.

## Prerequisites

- A running Kubernetes cluster.
- `kubectl` CLI tool installed and configured to communicate with your cluster.

## Steps

### 1. Create a Kubernetes Namespace

We will group our Pi-hole resources under a dedicated namespace called `pihole`.

```
kubectl create namespace pihole
```

### 2. Setup Sensitive Information using Kubernetes Secrets

To securely manage our Pi-hole web interface password, we'll store it in a Kubernetes Secret.

```
kubectl create secret generic pihole-secret --from-literal=WEBPASSWORD=yourpassword -n pihole
```

Replace `yourpassword` with your desired password.

### 3. Deploy Pi-hole

Use the provided `pihole-deployment.yaml` (from the previous conversation) to deploy Pi-hole. Ensure that the Deployment configuration references the secret for the `WEBPASSWORD` as shown:

```
...
env:
- name: TZ
  value: "America/New_York"
- name: WEBPASSWORD
  valueFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: pihole-secret
      key: WEBPASSWORD
...
```

Apply the deployment:

```
kubectl apply -f pihole-deployment.yaml
```

### 4. Accessing Pi-hole

Once deployed, you can access the Pi-hole web interface through the LoadBalancer's IP. To get the IP:

```
kubectl get svc pihole-service -n pihole
```

URL `http://192.168.1.203:PORT#/admin`

## Best Practices for Managing Secrets

- **Encryption**: Ensure your Kubernetes cluster encrypts data at rest. This keeps Secrets secure in etcd.
    
- **Access Control**: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict who can access Secrets.
    
- **Secret Rotation**: Rotate and refresh your secrets regularly.
    
- **Advanced Secret Management**: Consider using tools like HashiCorp's Vault for more complex secret management requirements.
    

Once you've set up your Pi-hole and pointed your network devices to use it as their primary DNS server, here are a few things you might consider:

1.  **Update Blocklists Regularly:** Pi-hole uses blocklists to filter out unwanted domains. These lists are updated periodically by their maintainers. You should update your blocklists regularly to ensure you're blocking the latest known ad and tracking domains. You can do this from the Pi-hole admin dashboard under "Tools" > "Update Gravity."
    
2.  **Whitelist & Blacklist Domains:** Over time, you might come across websites that don't work correctly because Pi-hole is blocking a necessary domain, or you might want to block additional domains manually. You can manage this via the "Whitelist" and "Blacklist" options in the Pi-hole dashboard.
    
3.  **Check the Dashboard Periodically:** The Pi-hole dashboard provides valuable insights into the number of queries processed, the number of blocked queries, and which domains are most frequently queried. This can help you identify potential issues or unwanted traffic on your network.
    
4.  **Set Up Password Protection:** If you haven't already, consider setting up a password for your Pi-hole admin dashboard to prevent unauthorized access.
    
5.  **Backup Your Configuration:** Consider backing up your Pi-hole configuration regularly, especially if you make custom changes to whitelists, blacklists, or other settings. This will make it easier to restore your setup if needed.
    
6.  **Update Pi-hole Software:** Just like any other software, Pi-hole receives updates that fix bugs, improve performance, and add new features. Check for updates regularly and apply them to keep your Pi-hole installation secure and up-to-date.
    
7.  **Consider Enabling HTTPS for the Admin Interface:** For added security, especially if you ever plan to access the admin interface from outside your local network, consider setting up HTTPS.
    
8.  **Network-Wide HTTPS Filtering (Optional):** To block ads on HTTPS sites more effectively, you can consider integrating Pi-hole with a software package like Unbound for DNS over HTTPS (DoH) or DNS over TLS (DoT). However, this is a more advanced setup and might not be necessary for all users.
